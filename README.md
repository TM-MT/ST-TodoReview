# TodoReview

A Sublime Text plugin for reviewing todo (and other) comments within your code.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is a fork of https://github.com/jonathanrdelgado/SublimeTodoReview
with some speed improvements and bug fixes. But I doubt that I really want to maintain this plugin.

## Installation

This plugin is not published on Package Control (and probably never will be).

To install this plugin via Package Control, you have to add a custom repository.

1. Execute `Package Control: Add Repository` in the command palette.
1. Add this custom repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfcherng-sublime/ST-my-package-control/master/repository.json`
1. Restart Sublime Text.
1. You should be able to install this package with Package Control with the name `CommandAndMenu`.
